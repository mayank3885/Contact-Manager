Hello, to run this application make sure you have installed NodeJS.

Now after opening this project in your local folder, install Node Modules.

Install uuid and react-router-dom.

After installing all these, open terminal and write npm start.

The data will be stored in server-api so make sure you have started it.

Thank you and have a good day.
